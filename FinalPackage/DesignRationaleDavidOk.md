Team Wealth Gap – Race and tech

My final visualization is a stacked column chart of major tech companies: Apple, eBay, Google and four others. While researching my story – racial disparities in the tech industry – I came across a graphic on Gigaom created by Biz Carson that inspired my stacked chart (Link to Carson’s work: http://bit.ly/1uV7l2E). Before I came across this graphic, I considered doing a multiple-column chart that had several columns per company, or multiple charts. The issue with this would have been that I would have had too many charts.

For my visualization, I found the Equal Employment Opportunity reports for my companies and organized the data with a spreadsheet. The reason why I decided to stick with the stacked columns is because I wanted to show the trend of Caucasians and Asian Americans making up the majority of the tech industry regardless of the size of the company.

When I began to code the project, I was faced with the challenge of learning how to set the bars to 100 percent. The Google Charts example I saw didn’t stack to 100 percent, but I found an example of what I was looking for on JSFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/qy6cn/) and plugged in my data. It was a little challenging because there were so many places where I had to add information about the companies and the pieces that made up each column. Luckily, I was able to pull it off the first time I tried, and the chart worked.

The first draft of my visualization used the default colors of the Google Chart visualizations, but for my second draft I was able to incorporate the colors of our target publication, Quartz. Although I used the same color palette that Quartz uses, I didn’t really feel that it looked like it belonged on Quartz. The reason for this is because some of the pieces of the columns were much larger than others, so certain colors dominated the graph.

When Maryanne Murray critiqued my visualization, she said that I should move the parts that I want to highlight to the bottom and use the darkest, boldest colors. As a result, I moved the black and Hispanic pieces of the columns to the bottom and used navy and a deep purple. Previously, I had the two pieces in the middle of the column in bright pink and magenta.

I wanted to include annotations for Apple and eBay because those were the only companies that didn’t have EEO reports available. Instead, they released diversity information as percentages of their employee populations. I took this information and reverse engineered the numbers from the most currently available employee counts. The annotations would have noted that the two companies’ columns were based on estimates. Since I couldn’t incorporate annotations, I used asterisks and made notes below my visualization.

When I turned in the final draft, my visualization had nine categories that made up each column. I consolidated categories like Native Hawaiian and American Indian into the “Other” category, since these minorities aren’t the focus of my story or visualization. As professor McGregor said, stacked column charts should have four categories or five at max. I feel like I’m pushing it a little because I have five categories, but I feel better that I brought the number down from nine.
