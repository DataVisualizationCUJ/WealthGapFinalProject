Design Rationale 

•	Chose the color pallete from Quartz (target publication)
o	Kept the colors of Main topic (Bangladeshis) in a different hue (maroon) from subsidiary data (Indian and Chinese) which is shown in shades of blue. 
•	Chose the typography from Quartz (target publication)
•	The data was comparison between groups using absolute numbers (in dollars, in percent). So, column chart was the choice of charting methodology
•	Highligthed the individual groups (0-17 and 65+) using background shadow to tie the story and visualization together
•	Added annotation for the average rates in both charts to give a baseline comparison for the data.
•	Number of Ticks for the vertical axes
o	For Income Levels: The nature of data points falling close to the tickmarks was the reason for only 3 tickmarks.
o	For poverty rates: Since the percentages are precise, chose to have more tickmarks at the interval 10 points.
•	Attribution for data source and tool used for making the charts was added at the bottom in smaller types, with relative close proximity to the axes.
