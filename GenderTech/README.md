Close: The visualization would be a trellis of bar charts that shows the number of 

women and men in the 5 most in-demand classes at General Assembly. The second 

chart will show overall enrollment across all General Assembly classes. The color 

scheme for this chart will follow Quartzâ€™s theme of purple, light blue and dark gray

Middle: It would be nice to also have data for an additional chart for the trellis that 

show the positions associated with the top 5 courses, and how each gender has filled 

them. There would be a hover effect that shows the average wage per position as the 

mouse moves over the bars. The mobile version of the this chart will not be in chart 

format. Rather, it will be a list of the courses with a sublist of related jobs and the 

percent breakdown of male and female.

Reach: Ideally, it would be nice to have a breakdown of how many men and women 

are obtaining computer science, engineering, information systems and similar 

degrees in Manhattan.
