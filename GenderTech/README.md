New York City’s tech industry has seen incredible growth in recent years, with venture capitalists bankrolling billions into the sector. Despite the success, corporations and organizations are still injecting money into tech but with one goal in mind: to close the diversity gap.

As the city with the worst wealth gap in the entire country, New York City’s “Silicon Alley” is creating new opportunities that pay, on average, 49 percent more than the city’s hourly wage, according to a report prepared by HR&A Advisors called “The New York City Tech Ecosystem.”

Firms invested $1.3 billion in 222 high-tech companies in 2013, according to the most current report available by the Office of the State Comptroller. And at 33 percent, job growth in the tech industry has been four times faster than in any other industry in New York.

The HR&A Advisors report states that New York City’s tech “ecosystem” has outpaced the growth of both the city and the U.S. in terms of new jobs. The city’s average hourly wage is $26.50, compared with $39.50 in tech.

However, the distribution of those capitalizing from these new opportunities is not equal. Caucasians and Asian-Americans make up the majority of people working in tech jobs, with black and Hispanic people making up between 1 and 7 percent of people working at several major tech companies.

This disparity is one that people like Tom O’Connell is attempting to fix – from a young age. O’Connell is the program director of C/I, which has three meanings: Code/Interactive, Camp/Interactive and Career/Interactive. The organization’s goal is to encourage under-served high school students to learn computing skills and to prepare them for jobs in the tech industry. O’Connell said he thinks that the reason for the diversity gap is because there simply aren’t enough people of color or women available to fill the current available positions.

“There’s a huge education gap in a lot of schools we work in and in low-income schools in the country,” he said. Not only that, but he said he’s observed the frustration children express when confronted with the challenging coding curriculum – stressful enough that the children end up giving up.

To address issue, C/I is set up as an incentive program for high schoolers aged 14 to 18 to climb to eventually intern at a major tech company. Code/Interactive is an after-school program in which students learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Those who show promise are invited to participate in the more intensive Camp/Interactive program where they can participate in Hackathons and further develop their products. The highest tier, Career/Interactive, pairs top students with companies where they can intern straight out of high school.

“I always tell [recruiters], ‘You’re not going to go to a college recruiting fair and find diversity today. But if you take someone under your wing from high school, then you might find someone in a couple of years,’ ” O’Connell said. “Everybody has to do their part to make sure these students go into tech, or it’s not going to happen.”

But sometimes, career paths are paved much later in life.

Adults, too, are seeking out programs that could help them to improve or even redirect their careers to tech, and the demand for education is apparent. General Assembly, which began as a coworking space four years ago, has now expanded to 13 educational campuses, with a 14th to open in the near future, said Anna Lindow, digital marketing instructor for General Assembly.

“We’re seeing a lot of desire around data and analytics,” she said. “All of our programming is designed to give people skills they can apply professionally.”


General Assembly students have gone on to work for companies like Spotify, The New York Times, JP Morgan and TD Ameritrade. In fact, the concept behind the organization’s full-time courses – which are held every day of the week – is intended as “education until employment,” Lindow said.

As General Assembly expands, the organization continues to adapt to industry needs, creating scholarship opportunities to under-served groups – people of color, women, veterans and those of lower income – through its Opportunity Fund. “We’ve granted a bunch of fellowships,” Lindow said. “The Fund is a way to cover the tuition of the program but also to give back to the community. We see it as a cycle.”

Among those who’ve received scholarships are women, who historically have not been highly represented in the tech industry. “As a woman in tech and as a woman in operations … I think there are lots of great things going on,” Lindow said. “One of the best things we can do is to offer people access, mentorship and exposure to people who are in the industry who do identify with those underrepresented groups.”
