"How many of you are working in tech full-time?" Chelsea Komlo, 27, 
asked in a hushed voice. Fewer than half of the women raised their hands. 
Komlo works as a software engineer at Thoughtworks, a technology company. 
She spoke to a group of 15 women, studying front-end web development at a study group 
hosted by Women Who Code NYC, an organization that hosts weekly classes and conferences 
featuring women technologists.

			She shared her personal story to encourage attendees 
			to continue their journey into technology, a world that 
			is primarily dominated by Caucasian and Asian men. 
			Komlo attended a web development training program, and 
			ahortly after graduating, she was hired as a software 
			engineer at Thoughtworks, a company that prides itself 
			on employing female engineers at a higher rate than other 
			tech giants like Facebook or Google.

					Low is an understatement. Technology is one of the fastest-growing 
					industries in New York City, employing nearly 300,000 people. 
					Women comprise 40 percent of the tech workforce in New York 
					but only 29 percent of technical roles at companies, according to a 
					report by HR&A Advisors, a New York-based advisory firm. 
					That's slightly higher than the national average of 26 percent, 
					according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology.

				Women technologists cite that a boys-club culture at technology 
				companies makes men more likely to employ other men than women. 
				A University of California Hastings report, however, showed that 
				both men and women were twice as likely to hire a man for a job that required math.

				Another reason for women's dismal numbers in tech is that fewer 
				women major in computer science now than before. Only 18 percent of computer 
				science majors who graduated with degrees were women, 
				according to the National Center for Women in Technology 
				compared to 37 percent in 1985. 
				The introduction of the personal computer in the 1984 
				was the reason for the decline, some experts believe. 
				These computers were catered to boys more than girls, 
				giving rise to a narrative of the geeky male computer programmer.

			While Komlo didn't major in computer science, 
			she and other employees at Thoughtworks 
			acknowledged that having a computer science degree is helpful and 
			makes it easier to get a job in technology. 
			But even then, women in science, engineering and 
			tech industries leave their careers at a much higher 
			rate than men. A report from the Center for Talent 
			Innovation shows that they are 45 percent more likely 
			than their male colleagues to leave their fields within a year. 
			The study cites an unsupportive work environment for women 
			and a sense of isolation as some of the reasons for women leaving the industry.

			The lack of women in technical roles affects how many women 
			are comfortable and confident enough in pursuing technology, 
			said Vanessa Hurst, co-founder of Girl Develop it, 
			a nonprofit that hosts classes on web development for women. 
			She majored in computer science at the University of Virginia 
			and considered herself lucky because there were "at least a few women" 
			in several of her classes. Nonetheless, she thought that after graduating, 
			she "would take on a less technical role because it seemed to be what other women did."

				When Hurst met Sarah Chipps, a fellow female web developer, 
				the two started discussing the challenges of being the only 
				women in class or on the job. Chipps declined to publicly 
				discuss her challenges working in technology although she 
				now runs an organization that supports young girls in 
				technology called Jewelbots. Her discussions with Hurst,
				 however, led to the idea of Girl Develop It in 2010. 
				 The first class took place in New York City, where Chipps taught HTML and CSS. 
				 It sold out, and their idea grew into an organization that spread 
				 to 46 cities and now the nonprofit operates internationally.

			New York City is catching up with nonprofits' 
			efforts to increase gender diversity in technology. 
			In May 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration 
			launched Tech Talent Pipeline, an initiative that's 
			part of a broader effort to train New Yorkers in technology 
			and connect them with companies looking for employees. The initiative'
			s director, Karen Titus, told New York Daily News that 55 percent
			 of the program's participants were women.

		Major companies are starting to address the lack of diversity in their companies, as well. 
		Google launched a $50 million program called Made with Code in June of 
		2014 to teach girls how to code, in a joint effort with the 
		Massachusetts Institute of Technology's MIT Media Lab, 
		Chelsea Clinton and actress Mindy Kaling, among others.

		The effort is part of a booming trend to support women in technology with over 
		20 New York-based groups listed on Meetup.com that host classes, 
		networking events and workshops on technical subjects for women who want to work in technology
		or who already work in technology but want a support system outside of their workplace.	
		More women technologists is better for technology, Hurst believes.
