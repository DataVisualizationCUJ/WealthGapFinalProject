Being one of a few women in her computer science classes, Sarah Chipps, a web developer, 
often shied away from asking questions in the classroom. When she met Vanessa Hurst, 
a fellow female web developer, the two started discussing the challenges of studying computer science in college. 

“When we were in classes and we were the only girls, we felt really awkward asking questions, 
because what if it’s a dumb question,” she said, fearing that “then people are like ‘girls are dumb.’” 

Their discussions led to the idea of Girl Develop It, an organization they founded in 2010 that 
teaches young women how to code. The first class in which Chipps taught HTML and CSS sold out. 
From there, it spread to other (TK exact number) cities and now the nonprofit operates internationally. 

Girl Develop It is one of dozens of organizations in New York City specifically aimed at increasing 
the number of women working in technology. There is Coalition for Queens, Women Who Code and BellaMinds. 
Girls Who Code, for instance, runs an seven-week summer program for high school sophomores and juniors that 
immerses them in computer science courses on subjects like robotics, web design and mobile development. 
Most recently, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration created a program called Tech Talent Pipeline, 
as part of a broader effort to train New Yorkers in technology and connect them companies looking for employees. 
Karen Titus, who heads the initiative, told New York Daily News that 55% of the program’s participants are women. 

Technology is one of the fastest-growing industries in New York City, employing nearly 300,000 people. 
However, it’s more often the case that men become employed at tech companies than women. 
Women comprise 40% of the tech workforce in New York, which includes administrative and human resources positions, 
but they comprise 29 percent of technical roles at companies, according to a report by HR&A Advisors, 
a New York-based advisory firm. 

Chipps and Hurst believe that social factors cause women to become less interested in technical subjects like math, 
science and computing as they get older. In college, there’s less women majoring in computer science. 
Only 12% of computer science majors who graduated with degrees were women, 
according to the National Center for Women in Technology. After graduation, many women leave their careers in computer science for various reasons, at a much higher rate than men. TK exact figures of women major in computer science/engineering fields in New York City universities and those that end of up working in computer science/engineering. 
The lack of women in technical roles affects how many women are comfortable and confident enough in pursuing technology, said Hurst. She majored in computer science at the University of Virginia, and thought that in her career, she “would take on a less technical role because it seemed to be what other women did.” 

“Computing is one of the most powerful tools we have,” Hurst said. “And we’re not going to be able to solve 
humanity’s most important problems unless we have enough different voices contributing to the solution. 

Major companies are starting to address the lack of diversity in their companies. On Aug. 21, AT&T 
pledged $1 million to help the organization expand its summer program. The announcement was made at the 
end of this year’s camp. Google, too, launched a $50 million program called Made with Code in June to 
teach girls how to code, in a joint effort with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s MIT Media Lab, 
Chelsea Clinton and actress Mindy Kaling, among others.

“Coding is a new literacy and it gives people the potential to create, innovate and quite literally 
change the world,” YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a statement announcing the program. 
“We’ve got to show all girls that computer science is an important part of their future, and that 
it’s a foundation to pursue their passions, no matter what field they want to enter."
