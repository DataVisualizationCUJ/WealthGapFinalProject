Re-Pitch and Close, Middle, Reach

Re-Pitch: I’ve chosen three different Manhattan colleges (Columbia, F.I.T and CUNY). 
These percentages were based upon students who were enrolled full time (FT) at these 
colleges and categorized by whether or not they pay in-state tuition or out-of-state tuition. 
Columbia is the most expensive but doesn’t increase in tuition price for undergraduate 
students that aren’t New York State residents.  I’ve used this in comparison to F.I.T and 
CUNY because although it doesn’t charge more for out of state tuition, it’s nearly triple 
the amount of the other two Manhattan colleges. Though they’re cheaper, out of state 
residents are paying nearly double what New York State students pay for the same 
education, how does this effect the wealth gap? This small portion of New York City 
undergraduate tuition cost is pushing students to borrow more just because they’re not 
residents in that particular state – leading them to borrow more than they would have had 
they been a resident in New York.  

Close
A plain white bar graph with two bars for each of the four schools: Columbia, F.I.T, CUNY and Hunter. The Y-Axis will be
named Tuition and will start at $0K and go up by $10K until it reaches $50K. The X-Axis will be named Manhattan Schools
and the four school ranking from lowest tuition to highest will be displated in bar graphs. The In state tuition bars will 
be black, the out-of-state bar will be light gray and wach will have a text box above them that say the actual tution prices 
in red. The name of the graph will be 'Manahattan Undergra COA Cost of Attendance Per year.

Middle:
I’d like my bar graph to include multiple college tuitions based out of Manhattan, 
New York.  For example, my list of three schools in Manhattan such as Columbia, FIT, 
and CUNY – I’ve calculated their average tuition for their four-year undergraduate 
students.  The style of this visualization will be coordinated from least expensive to most 
expensive. Each school name will be in plain black text. Each school will have three bars; 
one representing In-State Tuition, another will represent out-of-state tuition and the third 
will be total borrowed in the 2013/14school year. As we hover over each bar I’d like to 
show the exact cost for both bars representing each school in red. I would label the chart 
‘Manhattan In/Out-of-State Tuition: Is it worth it?’ in black bold text. 
My x-axis will be red – “Manhattan Colleges” and my y-axis will also be red – “Cost of 
Tuition”, starting at zero and counting up by 10 thousand (10K) until it reaches 70 
thousand (70K) My three bars will be color coordinated from ‘Dark Blue – In-State’, 
‘Light Blue – Out-of-State’, and ‘Grey – Net Price (Amount Borrowed).
On the right hand corner of my bar chart, I’d like to show four keys that describe the 
chart:
⏎ HOVER: FT Tuition Cost Per Year #993333
☐ In-State #336699
☐ Out-of-State #666666
☐ Net Price #000000

Reach
The reach scenario would be much more involved with multiple layers in a
line graph depicting the three schools and their tuition and % borrowed in 
2013.I'd like it to include clickable links to other articles and data. Along with color coordination in 
my line chart – I think it’d be interesting to show videos of students speaking about 
their opinion on what could help ease the amount of student loans taken out each 
year either via Skype or in person. Below the videos I could also link to their email 
and social platforms. These attributes would make it more interactive and put a 
human face to the issue, which is what I find most articles and data to be missing.
