Description: The visualization would be a trellis of bar charts that shows the number of 
women and men in the 5 most in-demand classes at General Assembly. The second 
chart will show overall enrollment across all General Assembly classes. The color 
scheme for this chart will follow Quartzâ€™s theme of purple, light blue and dark gray. 


Middle 

Description: It would be nice to also have data for an additional chart for the trellis that 
show the positions associated with the top 5 courses, and how each gender has filled 
them. There would be a hover effect that shows the average wage per position as the 
mouse moves over the bars. The mobile version of the this chart will not be in chart 
format. Rather, it will be a list of the courses with a sublist of related jobs and the 
percent breakdown of male and female.


Reach

Description: Ideally, it would be nice to have a breakdown of how many men and women 
are obtaining computer science, engineering, information systems and similar 
degrees in Manhattan.
