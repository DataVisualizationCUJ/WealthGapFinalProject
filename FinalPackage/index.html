											There are multiple ways students pay for their undergraduate education. Whether they’re borrowing, enrolled in work-study or applying for scholarships – it’s expensive. First year bachelor students at the Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC pay $24,680 in tuition per year. By graduation, four years and eight semesters later and from the tuition alone – they will owe nearly $100,000. In 2013, nearly 56% of F.I.T’s undergraduate class graduated with debt. These are hefty price tags to consider as a teenager fresh out of high school. Students and their families have a responsibility for finding a school that not only fulfills the student’s interests but also fits within the family’s fiscal constraints. For students without financial support, there are options for affording their college education. Resources such as the Federal Pell Grant, which is awarded through FAFSA, can be distributed to need-based students and does not have to be paid back.

											During the 2008 – 2011 recession, unemployed adults were enrolling in college credit courses at both associate (two year) and bachelor (four year) programs. People were not acquiring jobs, so to increase the chance of employment they were acquiring new skills and degrees. Fortunately for them, this strategy was successful, resulting in many individuals no longer perusing further education upon employment. Though interest in higher education has dropped, the cost of college tuition continues to increase every couple of years. According to a U.S Department of Education survey, 33.8% of students who attended two-year programs in 2011 were projected to be in loan-default rather than the 13.8% of student who graduated from a four-year bachelor program. Student Loan Justice is an organization dedicated to restoring standard consumer protections to student loans and focuses primarily on research, media outreach, and grassroots lobbying initiatives.

											According to founder, Alan Collinge, “Defaults are in fact a preferred outcome for the lending system, up to and including the federal government. This perverted, bad faith fiscal incentive has led to a myriad of systemic failings.” The Student Loan Justice website states. “Congress removed bankruptcy protections, refinancing rights, statutes of limitations, truth in lending requirements, fair debt collection practice requirements (for state agencies) and even removed state usury laws from applicability to federally guaranteed student loans.”

											<span class="anno-span"> Aside from loans, there are very few options for students looking to afford an undergraduate education such as grants, scholarships and work-study. Though the economy has picked up and jobs are being created everyday, the employment rate in New York City is the lowest it’s been since 2008, according to the New York State Department of Labor. But depending on a student’s field of study – there may be post-graduation earning potential. According to a PayScale College Salary Report for 2013-2014, Petroleum Engineering, Actuarial Mathematics and Nuclear Engineering have the highest earning potential of a salary between $60-$103,000 for a recent grad’s starting median pay. That being said, PayScale also reported degrees that most students pursue degrees in Business Administration, Psychology, Nursing and General Biology.

											<span class="anno-span"> For those who take future loan payments into account, seeking a degree in a particular field could help their future-selves. Along with finding options to afford college, varying in and out-of-state tuition can be a deal breaker. While it takes detailed strategic planning to look for other outlets that provide student aid, student loans are able to provide instant relief for students working toward a degree. Furthermore, students have to decide on programs with high quality education and increase the chance of future employment, or options that are more fiscally responsible, but perhaps don’t afford the same level of post-collegiate opportunities.

											<span class="anno-span"> Bridget Emslie, a New Jersey resident, graduated Ramapo College of New Jersey in May 2014. Emslie studied Nursing for four years and became employed at Mount Sinai as a Nurse Practitioner in Pediatric Services two months after graduation. As an In-State resident, Emslie’s tuition costs were cut nearly half from $22,000 a year to $13,000 a year. Emslie, who was also accepted to New York University, chose to attend Ramapo College of New Jersey not only for its excellent nursing program’s reputation but also because of the in-state tuition difference.

I knew once I graduated that my loans would be my problem since my mom wasn’t able to help me financially both before and after college,” said Emslie. Emslie also said that she knew it was her responsibility to choose a school that would have a maximum benefit with a minimal amount of money being held against her. She also hopes to pay off her $20,000 debt with in the next ten years once her finances are in order. “I didn't want to be paying off loans for the rest of my life for a degree I could get for a much more reasonable expense."

But call me in ten years and I'll probably say otherwise,” said Most. Most has not begun paying her loans because she is currently enrolled as a Graduate student at Columbia University in the City of New York.

My college bills were completely paid in full and out of pocket each semester. It became far less expensive once I was no longer living in the city and taking no more than three classes a week. My parents were spending around $2,000 each semester,” said Stoppiello.

											<span class="anno-span"> Chelsea Komlo, 27, stood at the front of the conference room where about 15 women sat with their laptops open on a Monday evening in the New York City office of Thoughtworks, a web development company, on Madison Avenue and 29th street. The women gathered for a study group on front-end web development hosted by Women Who Code NYC, an organization that wants to increase the number of women working in technology.

											She shared her personal story to encourage the women to continue their journey into technology, a world that is primarily dominated by Caucasian and Asian men. Komlo attended a web development training program. Shortly after graduating, she was hired as a software engineer at Thoughtworks, a company that prides itself on employing female engineers at a higher rate than other tech giants like Facebook or Google.

											Low is correct. Technology is one of the fastest-growing industries in New York City, employing nearly 300,000 people. Women comprise 40% of the tech workforce in New York but only 29 percent of technical roles at companies, according to a report by HR&A Advisors, a New York-based advisory firm. That's slightly higher than the national average of 26 percent, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology.

										<p data-annotation-count="0" data-thread-id="192027" data-article-id="392200" class="annotatable">
											<span class="anno-span"> Women technologists cite various reasons for their low numbers. A boys-club culture at technology companies makes men more likely to employ other men than women. A few studies cited in a University of California Hastings report, however, showed that both men and women were twice as likely to hire a man for a job that required math.

										<p data-annotation-count="0" data-thread-id="192028" data-article-id="392200" class="annotatable">
											<span class="anno-span"> Another reason is that fewer women major in computer science now than before. Only 18% of computer science majors who graduated with degrees were women, according to the National Center for Women in Technology compared to 37 percent in 1985.

											<span class="anno-span"> While Komlo didn't major in computer science, she and other employees at Thoughtworks acknowledged that having a computer science degree is helpful and makes it easier to get a job in technology. But even then, women in science, engineering and tech industries leave their careers at a much higher rate than men. In fact, a report from the Center for Talent Innovation shows that they are 45% more likely than their male colleagues to leave their fields within a year.

											<span class="anno-span"> The lack of women in technical roles affects how many women are comfortable and confident enough in pursuing technology, said Vanessa Hurst, co-founder of Girl Develop it, a nonprofit that hosts classes on web development for women. She majored in computer science at the University of Virginia and considered herself lucky because there were "at least a few women" in several of her classes. Nonetheless, she thought that after graduating, she "would take on a less technical role because it seemed to be what other women did."

											<span class="anno-span"> Girl Develop It boasts over 7,600 members in its NYC Meetup group and recently started collecting data that tracks participants' paths into technical careers. Similar organizations like Women Who Code, NYC Ruby and BellaMinds are just three of more than 20 groups listed on Meetup.com that aim to increase the number of women working in technology. Other organizations in the city include Coalition for Queens, Black Girls Code and CodeED NYC, all of whom run computer science classes for young girls, and particularly girls of color.

											<span class="anno-span"> New York City is catching up with nonprofits' efforts to increase gender diversity in technology. In May 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration launched Tech Talent Pipeline, an initiative that's part of a broader effort to train New Yorkers in technology and connect them with companies looking for employees. The initiative's director, Karen Titus, told New York Daily News that 55% of the program's participants are women.

											<span class="anno-span"> Major companies are starting to address the lack of diversity in their companies, as well. Google launched a $50 million program called Made with Code in June of 2014 to teach girls how to code, in a joint effort with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's MIT Media Lab, Chelsea Clinton and actress Mindy Kaling, among others.

											<span class="anno-span"> Thoughtworks considers itself ahead of the curve when it comes to diversity in its workforce. "We really try to stack the deck with historically discriminated groups," said Jared Hatch, a recruiter with Thoughtworks. "We want more Latinos, Native Americans, women, people who identify as LGBTQ." He believes diversity builds better products.

											<span class="anno-span"> New York City's tech industry has seen incredible growth in recent years, with the number of people employed in tech growing 33 percent between 2009 and 2013, according to a report by the state comptroller's office. The sector hired workers four times faster than any other industry in the city. However, a quick glance at the Equal Employment Opportunity reports of major companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter shows that these new job opportunities is not benefitting everyone equally.

The average pay for tech jobs is $39.50 per hour, according to a report prepared by HR&A Advisors. The report states that New York City's tech "ecosystem" has outpaced the growth of both the city and the U.S. in terms of new jobs.

											This disparity is one that people like Tom O'Connell is attempting to fix. O'Connell is the program director of C/I, which has three meanings: Code/Interactive, Camp/Interactive and Career/Interactive. The organization's goal is to encourage under-served high school students to learn computing skills and to prepare them for jobs in the tech industry. O'Connell said he thinks that the reason for the diversity gap is because there simply aren't enough people of color or women available to fill the current available positions.

O'Connell's program is based in the Bronx, where the racial makeup of high schools is dominated by black and Hispanic students. O'Connell said he's seen students in his program express frustration when confronted with the challenges of coding -- stressed enough that they end up giving up.

											<span class="anno-span"> To address issue, C/I is set up as an incentive program for high schoolers aged 14 to 18 to climb to eventually intern at a major tech company. Code/Interactive is an after-school program in which students learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Those who show promise are invited to participate in the more intensive Camp/Interactive program where they can participate in Hackathons and further develop their products. The highest tier, Career/Interactive, pairs top students with companies where they can intern straight out of high school.

											<span class="anno-span">Bangladeshis are the fastest growing foreign born population in New York City. With the fast growth come the problems of income inequality and poverty. The astronomical rise of almost 150 percent growth in population of Bangladeshis between last two censuses could be attributed to several sociopolitical reasons in their home country but the chief among them is the rise of economical instability in the country. These immigrants flooding into New York City for greener pastures have found an equally hard time for economic mobility in their adopted homes as well. The poverty rates among elderly and children population of Bangladeshis are the highest according to the Asian American Federation report.

											Despite the large growth, Bangladeshis still do not match up to the large immigrant population from the neighboring countries of India and China. The census bureau uses broad categorization of race and ethnicity in their process. The scholars who study these numbers are often frustrated with the lack of data on the statistically less significant groups. Annamaria Lusardi, Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College says that, “It is hard to study small sample sizes. Asians are a smaller group as compared to White, Black or Hispanic.”

											Despite the small percentage of population Asians are financially the fastest growing group. According to Census Bureau the median household of Asians is $66,000, which is higher than median household income in New York metropolitan area at $65,786 and nationally at $53,046. As an expert on financial literacy Lusardi points out that the income is not the only factor in determining the overall wealth of a group. There are other factors such as demand for skills in labor market, investments and savings. Some of these factors contribute to the stark difference between Chinese and Indian immigrants as compared to Bangladeshis. Lisa Keister, a sociologist at Duke University has been intensively studying Chinese and other Asian groups for past 10 years. She attributes the transnational investments among the Indian and Chinese as one of the major factors that differentiates them from other immigrant groups. “They would own property in their home countries as well as here,” says Keister.

											This is not possible for immigrants from Bangladesh. Misba Abdin is the co-founder and CEO of the Bangladeshi American Community Development and Youth Services. He has been working as a community worker and a philanthropist for past 26 years. He is part of a very close-knit community where he claims to know three out of four Bangladeshis in New York City. As compared to Chinese or Indian, the family sizes of Bangladeshis are twice or more with an average of four to six kids per family. “This puts a lot of financial strain on families…Even though a lot of kids go to college maybe out of ten kids two would end up going to college. The rest have to do odd jobs to make ends meet,” says Abdin.

											Bangladeshis have been coming to New York City in large numbers for only last 15 or so years. So the financial stability and access to services are not as easily attainable to them as compared to other groups who have had their roots here for much longer.  John Wong of the Asian American Business Development Center says, “Certain groups that are more established are better organized to access the resources” referring to the differences among the subgroups. This way, the longer one lives in America, the more prosperous one becomes seems to be true as seen in research by Keister.

											<span class="anno-span">Lusardi also says that, “Other people have argued that the differences could be due to the cultural effect.” The cultural effects in question are the ‘saving culture’ of Asians as compared to other groups. Among the major ethnic groups the savings are highest among different Asian subgroups. According to Pew Analysis of the data by census bureau the overall wealth of a household, which includes savings, assets and income, is $83,500 for Asians. Hispanic and Black populations are way behind $7,800 and $5,730 respectively.

											<span class="anno-span">Middle class populations are swelling in Asian countries of China, India, Indonesia and others. Wong thinks that this is another reason that could contribute to differences among the population. “They don’t have to go the traditional immigrant route of [working as unskilled] labor. They have earned money while in their native countries.” This is not the case for Bangladeshis because as Abdin says, “Most of [Bangladeshis] who come here are straight out of farm.” They cannot fulfill the demand for high-skilled jobs and end up doing the low-skilled labor.

											<span class="anno-span">The difference among the neo-middle class immigrants and more established immigrants could not be seen more starkly than in New York City. Seniors are the poorest Asian age group in New York City. 1 in 4 seniors live in poverty in New York City according to census analysis done by Asian American Federation. While the proportion of poor seniors is stable around 18 percent for the general population, Bangladeshi seniors have not seen any significant drop in their poverty. The situation is even worse for the children with almost 42 percent children living in poverty in our city.
