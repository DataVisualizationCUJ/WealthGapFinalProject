Not All Asians Are Wealthy

The issues of income inequality and wealth gap revolve around the gap between White and Black or White and Hispanic but what often gets sidelined is the fourth category created by the Census Bureau - Asians.

Annamaria Lusardi a professor of Economics at Dartmouth College says that, “It is hard to study small sample sizes. Asians are a smaller group as compared to White, Black or Hispanic.” Despite the small percentage of population Asians are financially the fastest growing group. According to Census Bureau the median household of Asians is $66,000, which is higher than median household income in New York metropolitan area at $65,786 and nationally at $53,046. As an expert on financial literacy Lusardi points out that the income is not the only factor in determining the overall wealth of a group. There are other factors such as demand for skills in labor market, investments and savings. 

Lusardi also says that, “Other people have argued that the differences could be due to the cultural effect.” The cultural effects in question are the Saving Culture of Asians as compared to other groups. According to Pew Analysis of the data by census bureau the overall wealth of a household is $83,500 for Asians as compared to $7,800 for Hispanic and $5,730 for Black. The sizable group differences are not so stark within subgroups of different Asian subgroups but they are worth noticing. The difference between median household incomes of Hmong ($42,689) and Indian ($88,000) is slightly over than double.  John Wong of the Asian American Business Development Center says, “Certain groups that are more established are better organized to access the resources” referring to the differences among the subgroups. 

“If you aggregate the family income then it makes [the median household income] a little higher.” Family sizes are bigger among Asian groupsthan other categories and that could be a contributing factor to the higher family income statistics. Middle class populations are swelling in Asian countries of China, India, Indonesia and others. Wong thinks that this is another reason that could contribute to differences among the population. “They don’t have to go the traditional immigrant route of [working as unskilled] labor. They have earned money while in their native countries.”

The difference among the neo-middle class immigrants and more established immigrants could not be seen more starkly than in New York City. Seniors are the poorest Asian age group in New York City. 1 in 4 seniors live in poverty in New York City according to census analysis done by Asian American Federation. While the proportion of poor seniors dropped from 31.3 percent to 25.3 between the last two censuses, the ratio still remains high among particular subgroups such as Bangladeshis and Chinese.
