This file contains the close-middle-reach scenarios for Yasmin Nouh and David Ok's tech story about gender and race.

Gender - tech

Close: The visualization would be a trellis of bar charts that shows the number of women and men in the 5 most in-demand classes at General Assembly. The second chart will show overall enrollment across all General Assembly classes. The color scheme for this chart will follow Quartz’s theme of purple, light blue and dark gray.

Middle: It would be nice to also have data for an additional chart for the trellis that show the positions associated with the top 5 courses, and how each gender has filled them. There would be a hover effect that shows the average wage per position as the mouse moves over the bars. The mobile version of the this chart will not be in chart format. Rather, it will be a list of the courses with a sublist of related jobs and the percent breakdown of male and female.

Reach: Ideally, it would be nice to have a breakdown of how many men and women are obtaining computer science, engineering, information systems and similar degrees in Manhattan.

Race - tech

Close: The visualization will be a demographic breakdown of the tech industry. The chart type will be a stacked bar graph with data from The NYC Tech Economy report. The “close” scenario will be a stacked bar chart of major tech companies that have released diversity reports: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, eBay, Yahoo and LinkedIn. The chart will use the colors that Quartz charts typically use: purple and light blue for the bars, with gray type for the axes. I envision the chart to look the same regardless of browser size/mobile device.

Middle: In the “middle” scenario, the chart would have a simple opening animation to show that the chart is interactive. Example: http://bit.ly/1G9DVo4. It would be nice if all of the tech companies in New York had diversity reports. I would include the top 10 companies with a breakdown of their demographics. It would be nice if the chart could be responsive to turn into a vertical column chart if the user were holding the phone vertically. 

Reach: Ideally, the chart will have the data from the major tech companies, as well as demographics data from the top emerging tech companies. I have a list of the top 10 emerging companies in New York – all of which are tech companies – from an Inc.com story from August 2014. I will be contacting each of these companies with the hopes of getting employee demographics. Considering I would want to have multiple datasets, this would be a trellis display with multiple stacked bar or pie charts. Ideally, the mobile version of the chart will be full screen when vertical or horizontal. When horizontal, it will be a bar chart, and when vertical it will be a column chart.
