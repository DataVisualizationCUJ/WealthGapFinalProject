					New York City's tech industry has seen incredible growth in recent years, with the number of people employed in tech growing 33 percent between 2009 and 2013, according to a report by the state comptroller's office. The sector hired workers four times faster than any other industry in the city. However, a quick glance at the Equal Employment Opportunity reports of major companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter shows that these new job opportunities is not benefitting everyone equally.

The average pay for tech jobs is $39.50 per hour, according to a report prepared by HR&A Advisors.

O'Connell is the program director of C/I, which has three meanings: Code/Interactive, Camp/Interactive and Career/Interactive. The organization's goal is to encourage under-served high school students to learn computing skills and to prepare them for jobs in the tech industry. O'Connell said he thinks that the reason for the diversity gap is because there simply aren't enough people of color or women available to fill the current available positions.

O'Connell's program is based in the Bronx, where the racial makeup of high schools is dominated by black and Hispanic students. O'Connell said he's seen students in his program express frustration when confronted with the challenges of coding -- stressed enough that they end up giving up.

					To address issue, C/I is set up as an incentive program for high schoolers aged 14 to 18 to climb to eventually intern at a major tech company. Code/Interactive is an after-school program in which students learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Those who show promise are invited to participate in the more intensive Camp/Interactive program where they can participate in Hackathons and further develop their products. The highest tier, Career/Interactive, pairs top students with companies where they can intern straight out of high school.

			Chelsea Komlo, 27, stood at the front of the conference room where about 15 women sat with their laptops open on a Monday evening in the New York City office of Thoughtworks, a web development company, on Madison Avenue and 29th street. The women gathered for a study group on front-end web development hosted by Women Who Code NYC, an organization that wants to increase the number of women working in technology.

			She shared her personal story to encourage the women to continue their journey into technology, a world that is primarily dominated by Caucasian and Asian men. Komlo attended a web development training program. Shortly after graduating, she was hired as a software engineer at Thoughtworks, a company that prides itself on employing female engineers at a higher rate than other tech giants like Facebook or Google.

			Low is correct. Technology is one of the fastest-growing industries in New York City, employing nearly 300,000 people. Women comprise 40% of the tech workforce in New York but only 29 percent of technical roles at companies, according to a report by HR&A Advisors, a New York-based advisory firm. That's slightly higher than the national average of 26 percent, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology.

			<br>

			<div id="story" class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4"></div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
			Women technologists cite various reasons for their low numbers. A boys-club culture at technology companies makes men more likely to employ other men than women. A few studies cited in a University of California Hastings report, however, showed that both men and women were twice as likely to hire a man for a job that required math.

			<div class="col-md-2"></div>
			</div>
			<br>

			<div id="story" class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4"></div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
			Another reason is that fewer women major in computer science now than before. Only 18% of computer science majors who graduated with degrees were women, according to the National Center for Women in Technology compared to 37 percent in 1985.

			</div>
			<div class="col-md-2"></div>

			<div id="story" class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4"></div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
			While Komlo didn't major in computer science, she and other employees at Thoughtworks acknowledged that having a computer science degree is helpful and makes it easier to get a job in technology. But even then, women in science, engineering and tech industries leave their careers at a much higher rate than men. In fact, a report from the Center for Talent Innovation shows that they are 45% more likely than their male colleagues to leave their fields within a year.

			The lack of women in technical roles affects how many women are comfortable and confident enough in pursuing technology, said Vanessa Hurst, co-founder of Girl Develop it, a nonprofit that hosts classes on web development for women. She majored in computer science at the University of Virginia and considered herself lucky because there were "at least a few women" in several of her classes. Nonetheless, she thought that after graduating, she "would take on a less technical role because it seemed to be what other women did."

			<br>

			<div id="story" class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4"></div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
			When Hurst met Sarah Chipps, a fellow female web developer, the two started discussing the challenges of being the only women in class or on the job. Chipps declined to publicly discuss the challenges she has had working in technology. Her discussions with Hurst, however, led to the idea of Girl Develop It, an organization they founded in 2010 that teaches young women how to code. The first class, where Chipps taught HTML and CSS, sold out. From there, it spread to 46 cities and now the nonprofit operates internationally.

			Girl Develop It boasts over 7,600 members in its NYC Meetup group and recently started collecting data that tracks participants' paths into technical careers. Similar organizations like Women Who Code, NYC Ruby and BellaMinds are just three of more than 20 groups listed on Meetup.com that aim to increase the number of women working in technology. Other organizations in the city include Coalition for Queens, Black Girls Code and CodeED NYC, all of whom run computer science classes for young girls, and particularly girls of color.

			New York City is catching up with nonprofits' efforts to increase gender diversity in technology. In May 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration launched Tech Talent Pipeline, an initiative that's part of a broader effort to train New Yorkers in technology and connect them with companies looking for employees. The initiative's director, Karen Titus, told New York Daily News that 55% of the program's participants are women.

			Major companies are starting to address the lack of diversity in their companies, as well.

			Thoughtworks considers itself ahead of the curve when it comes to diversity in its workforce. "We really try to stack the deck with historically discriminated groups," said Jared Hatch, a recruiter with Thoughtworks. "We want more Latinos, Native Americans, women, people who identify as LGBTQ." He believes diversity builds better products.
