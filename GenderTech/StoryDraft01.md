Chelsea Komlo, 27, stood at the front of the conference room where about 15 women sat with their laptops open 
on a Monday evening in the New York City office of Thoughtworks, a web development company, on Madison Avenue 
and 29th street. The women gathered for a study group on front-end web development hosted by Women Who Code NYC, 
an organization that wants to increase the number of women working in technology. 

“How many of you are working in tech full-time?” Komlo asked in a hushed voice. Less than half of the women 
raised their hands. 

She shared her personal story to encourage the women to continue their journey into technology, a world that 
is primarily dominated by Caucasian and Asian men. Komlo attended a web development training program. 
Shortly after graduating, she was hired as a software engineer at Thoughtworks, a company that prides 
itself on employing female engineers at a higher rate than other tech giants like Facebook or Google. 

“The figures are low,” Komlo said. “But I do think there’s an emerging awareness so that’s exciting.” 

Low is correct. Technology is one of the fastest-growing industries in New York City, employing nearly 300,000 people.
Women comprise 40% of the tech workforce in New York but only 29 percent of technical roles at companies, according to
 a report by HR&A Advisors, a New York-based advisory firm. That’s slightly higher than the national average of 
 26 percent, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology. 
  
Women technologists cite various reasons for their low numbers. A boys-club culture at technology companies 
makes men more likely to employ other men than women. A few studies cited in a University of California Hastings 
report, however, showed that both men and women were twice as likely to hire a man for a job that required math. 

Another reason is that fewer women major in computer science now than before. Only 18% of computer science majors
 who graduated with degrees were women, according to the National Center for Women in Technology compared to 
 37 percent in 1985. 

While Komlo didn’t major in computer science, she and other employees at Thoughtworks acknowledged that having
a computer science degree is helpful and makes it easier to get a job in technology. But even then, women in 
science, engineering and tech industries leave their careers at a much higher rate than men. In fact, 
a report from the Center for Talent Innovation shows that they are 45% more likely than their male colleagues 
to leave their fields within a year.

The lack of women in technical roles affects how many women are comfortable and confident enough in pursuing 
technology, said Vanessa Hurst, co-founder of Girl Develop it, a nonprofit that hosts classes on web development
for women. She majored in computer science at the University of Virginia and considered herself lucky because 
there were “at least a few women” in several of her classes. Nonetheless, she thought that after graduating, 
she “would take on a less technical role because it seemed to be what other women did.”

When Hurst met Sarah Chipps, a fellow female web developer, the two started discussing the challenges of
being the only women in class or on the job. Chipps declined to publicly discuss the challenges she has had working
in technology. Her discussions with Hurst, however, led to the idea of Girl Develop It, an organization they 
founded in 2010 that teaches young women how to code. The first class, where Chipps taught HTML and CSS, 
sold out. From there, it spread to 46 cities and now the nonprofit operates internationally.

Girl Develop It boasts over 7,600 members in its NYC Meetup group and recently started collecting data 
that tracks participants’ paths into technical careers. Similar organizations like Women Who Code, NYC Ruby 
and BellaMinds are just three of more than 20 groups listed on Meetup.com that aim to increase the number of 
women working in technology. Other organizations in the city include Coalition for Queens, Black Girls Code 
and CodeED NYC, all of whom run computer science classes for young girls, and particularly girls of color.

New York City is catching up with nonprofits’ efforts to increase gender diversity in technology. In May 2014, 
Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration launched Tech Talent Pipeline, an initiative that’s part of a broader 
effort to train New Yorkers in technology and connect them with companies looking for employees. 
The initiative’s director, Karen Titus, told New York Daily News that 55% of the program’s participants are women.

Major companies are starting to address the lack of diversity in their companies, as well. Google 
launched a $50 million program called Made with Code in June of 2014 to teach girls how to code, 
in a joint effort with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s MIT Media Lab, Chelsea Clinton 
and actress Mindy Kaling, among others. 

Thoughtworks considers itself ahead of the curve when it comes to diversity in its workforce. 
“We really try to stack the deck with historically discriminated groups,” said Jared Hatch, a recruiter with 
Thoughtworks. “We want more Latinos, Native Americans, women, people who identify as LGBTQ.” 
He believes diversity builds better products.

Hurst and other women technologists agree. 

“Computing is one of the most powerful tools we have,” Hurst said. “And we’re not going to be able to solve 
humanity’s most important problems unless we have enough different voices contributing to the solution.”
