					Chelsea Komlo, 27, stood at the front of the conference room where about 15 women sat with their laptops open on a Monday evening in the New York City office of Thoughtworks, a web development company, on Madison Avenue and 29th street. The women gathered for a study group on front-end web development hosted by Women Who Code NYC, an organization that wants to increase the number of women working in technology.

					"How many of you are working in tech full-time?" Komlo asked in a hushed voice. Less than half of the women raised their hands.

					She shared her personal story to encourage the women to continue their journey into technology, a world that is primarily dominated by Caucasian and Asian men. Komlo attended a web development training program. Shortly after graduating, she was hired as a software engineer at Thoughtworks, a company that prides itself on employing female engineers at a higher rate than other tech giants like Facebook or Google.

					Low is correct. Technology is one of the fastest-growing industries in New York City, employing nearly 300,000 people. Women comprise 40% of the tech workforce in New York but only 29 percent of technical roles at companies, according to a report by HR&A Advisors, a New York-based advisory firm. That's slightly higher than the national average of 26 percent, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology.

			<div id="story" class="row">
				<div class="col-md-4"></div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					Women technologists cite various reasons for their low numbers. A boys-club culture at technology companies makes men more likely to employ other men than women. A few studies cited in a University of California Hastings report, however, showed that both men and women were twice as likely to hire a man for a job that required math.

			</div>
			<br>

			<div id="story" class="row">
				<div class="col-md-4"></div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					Another reason is that fewer women major in computer science now than before. Only 18% of computer science majors who graduated with degrees were women, according to the National Center for Women in Technology compared to 37 percent in 1985.

				<div class="col-md-2"></div>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					While Komlo didn't major in computer science, she and other employees at Thoughtworks acknowledged that having a computer science degree is helpful and makes it easier to get a job in technology. But even then, women in science, engineering and tech industries leave their careers at a much higher rate than men. In fact, a report from the Center for Talent Innovation shows that they are 45% more likely than their male colleagues to leave their fields within a year.

					The lack of women in technical roles affects how many women are comfortable and confident enough in pursuing technology, said Vanessa Hurst, co-founder of Girl Develop it, a nonprofit that hosts classes on web development for women. She majored in computer science at the University of Virginia and considered herself lucky because there were "at least a few women" in several of her classes. Nonetheless, she thought that after graduating, she "would take on a less technical role because it seemed to be what other women did."

			<div id="story" class="row">

				<div class="col-md-6">
					When Hurst met Sarah Chipps, a fellow female web developer, the two started discussing the challenges of being the only women in class or on the job. Chipps declined to publicly discuss the challenges she has had working in technology. Her discussions with Hurst, however, led to the idea of Girl Develop It, an organization they founded in 2010 that teaches young women how to code. The first class, where Chipps taught HTML and CSS, sold out. From there, it spread to 46 cities and now the nonprofit operates internationally.

					Girl Develop It boasts over 7,600 members in its NYC Meetup group and recently started collecting data that tracks participants' paths into technical careers. Similar organizations like Women Who Code, NYC Ruby and BellaMinds are just three of more than 20 groups listed on Meetup.com that aim to increase the number of women working in technology. Other organizations in the city include Coalition for Queens, Black Girls Code and CodeED NYC, all of whom run computer science classes for young girls, and particularly girls of color.

					New York City is catching up with nonprofits' efforts to increase gender diversity in technology. In May 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration launched Tech Talent Pipeline, an initiative that's part of a broader effort to train New Yorkers in technology and connect them with companies looking for employees. The initiative's director, Karen Titus, told New York Daily News that 55% of the program's participants are women.

					Major companies are starting to address the lack of diversity in their companies, as well. Google launched a $50 million program called Made with Code in June of 2014 to teach girls how to code, in a joint effort with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's MIT Media Lab, Chelsea Clinton and actress Mindy Kaling, among others.

					Thoughtworks considers itself ahead of the curve when it comes to diversity in its workforce. "We really try to stack the deck with historically discriminated groups," said Jared Hatch, a recruiter with Thoughtworks. "We want more Latinos, Native Americans, women, people who identify as LGBTQ." He believes diversity builds better products.

					Hurst and other women technologists agree. "Computing is one of the most powerful tools we have," Hurst said. "And we're not going to be able to solve humanity's most important problems unless we have enough different voices contributing to the solution."
