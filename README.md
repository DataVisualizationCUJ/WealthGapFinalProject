FINAL PROJECT PITCH
Team Wealth Gap

1. The target publication for this package. You should be thinking about a specific audience when conceiving your stories; choose a target publication that fits your intended audience. If a general news organization, name a specific department/section. Why would this audience be interested in this topic?

The target publication for this package is Quartz. Quartz’s audience is young business professionals and it has also covered issues that capture the intersections of race and economic affairs. 

2. A brief (2-paragraph) overview of competitive coverage. Have others covered this topic before/recently? If so, what are their angles? Why is it still worth covering?

These topics have been covered in Huffington Post, Business Insider, the Wall Street Journal, DNAInfo, Quartz, NBC, CNN Money, Bloomberg, Daily Finance, Tech Crunch, Fast Company and the New York Times. They are still worth covering because income inequality and the economy will likely have to be addressed in the upcoming presidential campaigns. 
In a time of rising income inequality around the country, some Americans are recovering better than others from the 2008 recession. For this package, we’ve decided to look at income inequality through the angle of race. The first story will examine the racial wealth gap and look at the entire city’s income by employment sector, highlighting any racial or ethnic differences that may exist. 
Some minority groups are faring off better than others post-2008 recession. Asians are closing the racial wealth gap with whites. Story two will critically contextualize the rising affluence of Asian families in New York City, in particular. Do Asians in New York have distinctly higher educational achievement than other groups? Are the gains in affluence concentrated in certain sub-sections of the Asian community? Are they entering professions, perhaps like tech, that are better-paying? 
Speaking of technology, it’s the fastest-growing industry in New York. Story three will address both the educational path and demographics of the tech industry in New York City. Is there a certain type of education required to access or be successful in tech here? Who is getting these jobs? Race will factor into this as technology tends to lack racial diversity. 
The fourth story will critically address how student loans and college debt impact the immediate and long-term earning and employment prospects of today's recent graduates. Given that the highest borrowing race is black, followed by Hispanic, then white, then Asian, this story will also break down students’ debt experience by race. 


 
STORIES

STORY #1—The racial wealth gap in New York City

Pitch:

This story is about rising income inequality in New York City, which has the highest income gap in between rich and poor in the United States. For this story, I will look into New York City’s income by employment sector, breaking down any existing racial and ethnic differences. Since the 2008 recession, Hispanic and Black earners have had a harder time in the recovery than white and the Asian population in New York City, thus widening the racial wealth gap. This is more so due to socioeconomic differences. Generally speaking, there is a higher concentration of African Americans and Hispanics in lower-income parts of New York City and middle-lower income earners were harder hit by the recession than higher-income earners. 
According to James Parrott, FPI’s Deputy Director and Chief Economist: “Nearly four out of five low-wage New York City workers are persons of color, and workers of color are twice as likely as a white, non-Hispanic worker to be low-wage—48% of black workers and 55% of Latino workers are paid less than $14 an hour, while 23% of white workers are paid less than $14 an hour.” Additionally, African Americans and Hispanics tend to have lower higher graduation rates, and people who attain higher education typically tend to earn higher salaries. 
The stakeholders for this story are the city’s residents and local politicians. In fact, Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed the city’s income gap while he was running for office and has made it a part of his city agenda.

Visualizations

1.	The first visualization will be a bar chart and I imagine it to show what proportion of total income do the upper- middle- and lower-income earners control in New York City and how that has changed over the past 10 years. I would like to include something that shows what proportion of those earners are white, black and hispanic. 
2.	The second visualization will be a map showing ethnic breakdown and wealth concentration in New York City.

STORY 2 - Tri-State College Debt
Pitch:

	We know that most people accumulate close to $100,000 in debt from borrowing student loans, but what makes race a major pitfall for the students who borrow? The U.S Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics calculated that Black and Hispanic students take much longer to pay off their debt. According to Bloomberg Business, Black and White students borrowed the same amount in 2012 but black students take a larger hit by paying off their debt for many more years that white students. The question I pose is why do black students have more trouble finding well paying jobs that enable them to pay off their student debt? I’d like to see how Obama’s “Pay As You Earn” or PAYE program that began in 2012 has made a difference in the way recent graduates are coping with their student debt, as well as other loan-assistance programs. I’d also like to see how students are targeting their job search to maximize their tuition ROI, so to speak.

Data:
1. Student Debt and the Class of 2014 http://projectonstudentdebt.org/files/pub/Student_Debt_and_the_Class_of_2013_NR.pdf, a project focused on making higher education more available and affordable for people of all backgrounds released a report in November 2014 and it calculated the cumulative student loan debt of recent college graduates from four-year schools. It estimates state-by-state averages and identifies high- and low-debt schools. They use figures provided voluntarily by more than half of all public and nonprofit bachelor’s degree granting four-year colleges, representing 83% of bachelor’s degree recipients from those two types of colleges combined. For-profit bachelor’s degree granting four-year colleges are not included in any of this report’s 2013 figures because only one percent of the surveyed colleges, representing three percent of for-profit bachelor’s degree recipients, chose to provide debt data.

Visualizations: 

I would say that the most appropriate visualization of this Manhattan Student Debt by Race data would be a bar chart and/or line graph. It will represent student income post graduation broken down between average White and Black student debt within four different Manhattan colleges. I would like to integrate data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who reported that between 2004 and 2012, student debt tripled from $365 Billion to $966 Billion within six years. The Wisconsin Hope Lab also produced a survey in 2014, The color of Student Debt, which broke down the amount of borrowed between black, white, Hispanic, native American and Asian. I’d like to use the data specific to black and white students and show the differences borrowed through subsidized and unsubsidized loans.  

STORY 3 - Tech Industry

Pitch:
       	The growing tech industry is creating new opportunities that pay, on average, 49 percent more than New York City’s hourly wage, according to a report called “The New York City Tech Ecosystem.” But who are the people obtaining these jobs and how are they doing so? This story will focus on the demographics of the tech industry and show who is getting these jobs. White people and Asians make up the majority of people working in tech jobs, with black and Hispanic people making up only 1 and 7 percent of people working at several major tech companies. This story will break down the current demographics of the tech industry by race, as well as identify the types of college degrees and programs that people are pursuing in order to find tech jobs. I will also include the recruiters’ side to show what types of people they look for when filling tech positions.

Visualizations: 
1.     The first visualization will be a demographic breakdown of the tech industry. The chart type will be either a stacked bar graph or it will be a pie chart with data from the diversity reports of major tech companies: Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple, eBay, Yahoo and LinkedIn. Each bar or pie slice will be a racial breakdown of the company. This idea was inspired by graphs created by Biz Carson for http://gigaom.com. (Link to Carson’s work: http://bit.ly/1uV7l2E) The reason for choosing a pie chart is so that I’m not creating a chart that looks exactly like Biz Carson’s. Another possibility would be to do a stacked column chart.
2.     The second visualization will show the job growth of the tech industry, compared to other major industries that drive New York, as well as the average U.S. growth. The information will be conveyed in a line graph showing growth over time with data from either the Bureau of Labor Statistics or The NYC Tech Economy.



STORY 4 - Asians and the wealth gap

Pitch: 

Asian families are closing the racial wealth gap with white families. The typical Asian family has earned more money than white families for most of the past two decades and federal researchers estimate that Asian earners will surpass whites in net worth in the next 10 to 20 years. This story will address the factors that have contributed to how Asian families have been able to consistently bring in higher earnings – education levels, industry demographics and ethnicity. Asian families tend to emphasize education, with 65% of Asians between ages 35 and 39 having a college degree, compared with 42% of whites, 26% of blacks and 16% of Hispanics, according to the Census Bureau.
