The focus of the story has shifted in this draft. I have focused more on the granularity of the sub groups.

The staggering poverty and income numbers of Bangladeshis had to be addressed. So I compared the Bangladeshis to Indian and Chinese because they are statistically the largest groups in NYC. 

With the change in focus of the story, the Close-Middle-Reach Scenarios have also changed. 

Close

· Bar graph comparing new york subgroups (Indian, Chinese, Bangladeshi) to national subgroups median household income with reference line for overall median income.

· The line graphic with added line for comparing with the overall family median income

· All done in the QZ color palette of purple, light blue, dark grey on a light grey background

· Responsive/Selective design: Not showing the annotations in smaller sizes

· Another column chart comparing the three groups children and elderly poverty rates and showing the comparison with the overall population average.

Middle

· Highlight Bangladeshi history through line chart: Show the history of immigration through the population changes and income level changes.

· For second chart: Make it click-through to show the borough-wise breakdown


Reach

· Add videos and photos from each human source

· Embed audio/photo along with annotations in the line graph

· Make the pie chart animated and break out the separate slices and have embedded annotations with the most important observations for each category
