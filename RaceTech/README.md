This file contains the close-middle-reach scenarios for Yasmin Nouh and David Ok's tech story about gender and race.

The story is below the close-middle-reach scenarios.

Visualizations - First and second iterations
Gender - tech

Second draft of gender visualization:
![This image is the second draft of Yasmin Nouh's gender chart] (images/SecondGender.jpg)
The chart is now styled to match Quartz's color scheme and font.

![This image is for the Close scenario for the Gender-Tech visualization] (images/Gender01.jpg)
Close: The visualization would be a trellis of bar charts that shows the number of women and men in the 5 most in-demand classes at General Assembly. The second chart will show overall enrollment across all General Assembly classes. The color scheme for this chart will follow Quartz’s theme of purple, light blue and dark gray.

![This image is for the Middle scenario for the Gender-Tech visualization] (images/Gender02.jpg)
Middle: It would be nice to also have data for an additional chart for the trellis that show the positions associated with the top 5 courses, and how each gender has filled them. There would be a hover effect that shows the average wage per position as the mouse moves over the bars. The mobile version of the this chart will not be in chart format. Rather, it will be a list of the courses with a sublist of related jobs and the percent breakdown of male and female.

Reach: Ideally, it would be nice to have a breakdown of how many men and women are obtaining computer science, engineering, information systems and similar degrees in Manhattan.

Race - tech

Second draft of race visualization:
![This image is the second draft of David Ok's race chart] (images/SecondRace.jpg)
The chart is now styled to match Quartz's color scheme and font.

![This image is for the Close scenario for the Race-Tech visualization] (images/Race01.jpg)
Close: The visualization will be a demographic breakdown of the tech industry. The chart type will be a stacked bar graph with data from The NYC Tech Economy report. The “close” scenario will be a stacked bar chart of major tech companies that have released diversity reports: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, eBay, Yahoo and LinkedIn. The chart will use the colors that Quartz charts typically use: purple and light blue for the bars, with gray type for the axes. I envision the chart to look the same regardless of browser size/mobile device.

![This image is for the Middle scenario for the Race-Tech visualization] (images/Race02.jpg)
Middle: In the “middle” scenario, the chart would have a simple opening animation to show that the chart is interactive. Example: http://bit.ly/1G9DVo4. It would be nice if all of the tech companies in New York had diversity reports. I would include the top 10 companies with a breakdown of their demographics. It would be nice if the chart could be responsive to turn into a vertical column chart if the user were holding the phone vertically. 

![This image is for the Reach scenario for the Race-Tech visualization] (images/Race03.jpg)
Reach: Ideally, the chart will have the data from the major tech companies, as well as demographics data from the top emerging tech companies. I have a list of the top 10 emerging companies in New York – all of which are tech companies – from an Inc.com story from August 2014. I will be contacting each of these companies with the hopes of getting employee demographics. Considering I would want to have multiple datasets, this would be a trellis display with multiple stacked bar or pie charts. Ideally, the mobile version of the chart will be full screen when vertical or horizontal. When horizontal, it will be a bar chart, and when vertical it will be a column chart.

Story Draft 2
DAVID OK

New York City’s tech industry has seen incredible growth in recent years, with job growth jumping 33 percent between 2009 and 2013, according to a report by the state comptroller’s office. The sector hired workers four times faster than any other industry in the city. However, a quick glance at the Equal Employment Opportunity reports of major companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter shows that the distribution of benefits from new opportunities is not equal across races and genders.

As the city with the worst wealth gap in the entire country, New York City’s “Silicon Alley” is creating new opportunities that pay 49 percent more than the city’s average hourly wage of $26.50. The average pay for tech jobs is $39.50 per hour, according to a report prepared by HR&A Advisors called “The New York City Tech Ecosystem.”

The report states that New York City’s tech “ecosystem” has outpaced the growth of both the city and the U.S. in terms of new jobs. This is no surprise, as venture capitalists have been investing billions into the industry. 

In 2014, venture capital firms invested $3.1 billion in tech companies, a 61-percent increase compared with 2013, according to “The Money Tree” report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, based on data from Thomson Reuters. Some investments are geared toward closing the diversity cap.

Caucasians and Asian-Americans make up the majority of people working in tech jobs, with black and Hispanic people making up between 1 and 11 percent of people working at companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter.

This disparity is one that people like Tom O’Connell is attempting to fix. O’Connell is the program director of C/I, which has three meanings: Code/Interactive, Camp/Interactive and Career/Interactive. The organization’s goal is to encourage under-served high school students to learn computing skills and to prepare them for jobs in the tech industry. O’Connell said he thinks that the reason for the diversity gap is because there simply aren’t enough people of color or women available to fill the current available positions.

“There’s a huge education gap in a lot of schools we work in and in low-income schools in the country,” he said. O’Connell’s program is based in the Bronx, where the racial makeup of high schools is dominated by black and Hispanic students. O’Connell said he’s seen students in his program express frustration when confronted with the challenges of coding – stressed enough that they end up giving up.

To address issue, C/I is set up as an incentive program for high schoolers aged 14 to 18 to climb to eventually intern at a major tech company. Code/Interactive is an after-school program in which students learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Those who show promise are invited to participate in the more intensive Camp/Interactive program where they can participate in Hackathons and further develop their products. The highest tier, Career/Interactive, pairs top students with companies where they can intern straight out of high school.

C/I operates by training teachers to teach students how to code. O’Connell joined the organization two years ago as one of its first pilot teachers and helped to create training plans to speed up the learning process for teachers new to the program. Before C/I, O’Connell was a high school physics teacher in Houston, Texas, where he saw how students fared in STEM settings.

“I always tell [recruiters], ‘You’re not going to go to a college recruiting fair and find diversity today. But if you take someone under your wing from high school, then you might find someone in a couple of years,’” O’Connell said. “Everybody has to do their part to make sure these students go into tech, or it’s not going to happen.”

But sometimes, career paths are paved much later in life. Adults, too, are seeking out programs that could help them to improve or even redirect their careers to tech, and the demand for education is apparent. 

General Assembly, which began as a coworking space for startups nearly four years ago, has now expanded to 13 campuses worldwide where students attend classes to learn or develop programming skills, said Anna Lindow, digital marketing instructor for General Assembly. Students enroll to change careers or to improve their skills, she said, with classes ranging from $35 for one-time seminars to $10,500 for an intensive 10-week course on topics like user experience and product management.

“We’re seeing a lot of desire around data and analytics,” she said. “All of our programming is designed to give people skills they can apply professionally.”

General Assembly students have gone on to work for companies like Spotify, The New York Times, JP Morgan and TD Ameritrade. In fact, the concept behind the organization’s full-time courses – which are held every day of the week – is intended as “education until employment,” Lindow said.

As General Assembly expands, the organization continues to adapt to industry needs, offering fellowships to under-served groups – people of color, women, veterans and those of lower income – through its Opportunity Fund, which is supported by companies like CapitalOne, Microsoft and Google, as well as individual donors.

“We’ve granted a bunch of fellowships,” Lindow said. “The Fund is a way to cover the tuition of the program but also to give back to the community. We see it as a cycle.” Fellows are required to commit more than 100 volunteer hours to a nonprofit as part of the program. [TK – Fellows. Hoping to secure an interview this week.]

Among those who’ve received fellowships are women, who historically have not been highly represented in the tech industry.

“As a woman in tech and as a woman in operations … I think there are lots of great things going on,” Lindow said. “One of the best things we can do is to offer people access, mentorship and exposure to people who are in the industry who do identify with those underrepresented groups.”

Chelsea Komlo, 27, stood at the front of the conference room where about 15 women sat with their laptops open on a Monday evening in the New York City office of Thoughtworks, a web development company, on Madison Avenue and 29th street. The women gathered for a study group on front-end web development hosted by Women Who Code NYC, an organization that wants to increase the number of women working in technology. 

“How many of you are working in tech full-time?” Komlo asked in a hushed voice. Less than half of the women raised their hands. 

She shared her personal story to encourage the women to continue their journey into technology, a world that is primarily dominated by Caucasian and Asian men. Komlo attended a web development training program. Shortly after graduating, she was hired as a software engineer at Thoughtworks, a company that prides itself on employing female engineers at a higher rate than other tech giants like Facebook or Google. 

“The figures are low,” Komlo said. “But I do think there’s an emerging awareness so that’s exciting.” 

Low is correct. Technology is one of the fastest-growing industries in New York City, employing nearly 300,000 people. Women comprise 40% of the tech workforce in New York but only 29 percent of technical roles at companies, according to a report by HR&A Advisors, a New York-based advisory firm. That’s slightly higher than the national average of 26 percent, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology. 
  
Women technologists cite various reasons for their low numbers. A boys-club culture at technology companies makes men more likely to employ other men than women. A few studies cited in a University of California Hastings report, however, showed that both men and women were twice as likely to hire a man for a job that required math. 

Another reason is that fewer women major in computer science now than before. Only 18% of computer science majors who graduated with degrees were women, according to the National Center for Women in Technology compared to 37 percent in 1985. 

While Komlo didn’t major in computer science, she and other employees at Thoughtworks acknowledged that having a computer science degree is helpful and makes it easier to get a job in technology. But even then, women in science, engineering and tech industries leave their careers at a much higher rate than men. In fact, a report from the Center for Talent Innovation shows that they are 45% more likely than their male colleagues to leave their fields within a year.

The lack of women in technical roles affects how many women are comfortable and confident enough in pursuing technology, said Vanessa Hurst, co-founder of Girl Develop it, a nonprofit that hosts classes on web development for women. She majored in computer science at the University of Virginia and considered herself lucky because there were “at least a few women” in several of her classes. Nonetheless, she thought that after graduating, she “would take on a less technical role because it seemed to be what other women did.”

When Hurst met Sarah Chipps, a fellow female web developer, the two started discussing the challenges of being the only women in class or on the job. Chipps declined to publicly discuss the challenges she has had working in technology. Her discussions with Hurst, however, led to the idea of Girl Develop It, an organization they founded in 2010 that teaches young women how to code. The first class, where Chipps taught HTML and CSS, sold out. From there, it spread to 46 cities and now the nonprofit operates internationally.

Girl Develop It boasts over 7,600 members in its NYC Meetup group and recently started collecting data that tracks participants’ paths into technical careers. Similar organizations like Women Who Code, NYC Ruby and BellaMinds are just three of more than 20 groups listed on Meetup.com that aim to increase the number of women working in technology. Other organizations in the city include Coalition for Queens, Black Girls Code and CodeED NYC, all of whom run computer science classes for young girls, and particularly girls of color.

New York City is catching up with nonprofits’ efforts to increase gender diversity in technology. In May 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration launched Tech Talent Pipeline, an initiative that’s part of a broader effort to train New Yorkers in technology and connect them with companies looking for employees. The initiative’s director, Karen Titus, told New York Daily News that 55% of the program’s participants are women.

Major companies are starting to address the lack of diversity in their companies, as well. Google launched a $50 million program called Made with Code in June of 2014 to teach girls how to code, in a joint effort with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s MIT Media Lab, Chelsea Clinton and actress Mindy Kaling, among others. 

Thoughtworks considers itself ahead of the curve when it comes to diversity in its workforce. “We really try to stack the deck with historically discriminated groups,” said Jared Hatch, a recruiter with Thoughtworks. “We want more Latinos, Native Americans, women, people who identify as LGBTQ.” He believes diversity builds better products.

Hurst and other women technologists agree. “Computing is one of the most powerful tools we have,” Hurst said. “And we’re not going to be able to solve humanity’s most important problems unless we have enough different voices contributing to the solution.”
