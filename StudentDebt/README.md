# FinalProject Draft 1
*Insert Overview Blurb*


Re-Pitch: I’ve chosen three different Manhattan colleges (Columbia, F.I.T and CUNY). 
These percentages were based upon students who were enrolled full time (FT) at these 
colleges and categorized by whether or not they pay in-state tuition or out-of-state tuition. 
Columbia is the most expensive but doesn’t increase in tuition price for undergraduate 
students that aren’t New York State residents.  I’ve used this in comparison to F.I.T and 
CUNY because although it doesn’t charge more for out of state tuition, it’s nearly triple 
the amount of the other two Manhattan colleges. Though they’re cheaper, out of state 
residents are paying nearly double what New York State students pay for the same 
education, how does this effect the wealth gap? This small portion of New York City 
undergraduate tuition cost is pushing students to borrow more just because they’re not 
residents in that particular state – leading them to borrow more than they would have had 
they been a resident in New York. 

Undergraduate Student Debt by Tom Davis

There are a couple of ways students pay for their undergraduate education; they have

resources to acquire the money on their own accord, they can borrow through student 

loans or they are on a need based plan that requires help from the state, either through 

grants, loans, scholarships or work-study. 

Either route a student takes, they still have to pay something. In America, students begin 

to make major life decisions once they’re in their junior in high school. These students 

are usually around the age 17-19 when they’re asked to choose colleges, careers and 

make fiscally responsible decisions. 

Choosing a college can be tough. Teenagers have to find a school that not only fits their 

interests but also suits their financial capabilities, in return affecting where they go to 

school and the opportunities/disadvantages that come along with. 

Student Loan Justice is an organization dedicated to returning standard consumer 

protections to student loans and has focuses primarily on research, media outreach, and 

grassroots lobbying initiatives. 

Founder of the Student Loan Justice organization, Alan Collinge said, “Many people who 

are paying student loans aren't able to pay enough to reduce their balances so they are 

seeing their debt increase every year rather than the opposite.”

Do those who can afford get more?

American education comes with a price tag, but not only are expenses a nightmare but 

what they school has to offer can have a major affect on a students life post college 

graduation. Though students are walking out with a bachelor’s degree and more loans 

than they know what to do with – there may be post-graduation earning potential.

According to a PayScale College Salary Report for 2013-2014, Petroleum Engineering, 

Actuarial Mathematics and Nuclear Engineering have the highest earning potential of 

a salary between $60-$103,000 for a recent grad’s starting median pay.

ANALYSIS ON THAT EARNING POTENTIAL

Navigating the financial system as an undergraduate student can be daunting and 

intimidating. Students are borrowing money to afford school because they can and feel it 

may be there only option to experience future opportunities. 

Anne Most, 22, a recent Drexel University graduate owed close to $150, 000 for four 

years but with the help of her parents and a few grants, Most left with a little under 

$50,000 in student loans.

“I can't say that I let money have much of an impact on my undergraduate 

education. I guess my motto was enjoy now, pay later. Paying back my loans will 

certainly be a grueling process, but going to Drexel gave me opportunities that I 

couldn't haven gotten anywhere else, so I don't regret it at all. But call me in ten 

years and I'll probably say otherwise,” said Most.

Though F.I.T’s undergraduate student tuition amounts to just under $18K, the cost 

doesn’t stop there. If you take into account Health Insurance, Health Services,
