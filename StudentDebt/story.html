There are multiple ways students pay for their undergraduate education. Whether they’re

borrowing loans, paying out of pocket or using other means – it’s expensive. First year 

bachelor students at the Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC pay $24,680 in tuition 

per year. By graduation, four years and eight semesters later and from the tuition alone – 

they will owe nearly $100,000. In 2013, nearly 56% of F.I.T’s undergraduate class 

graduated with debt.  

These are hefty price tags to consider as a teenager fresh out of high school. Students and 

their families have a responsibility for finding a school that not only fulfills the student’s 

interests but also fits within the family’s fiscal constraints. 

For students without financial support, there are options for affording their college 

education. Resources such as the Federal Pell Grant, which is awarded through FAFSA, 

can be distributed to need-based students and does not have to be paid back.											<div class="anno-right" data-count="0">

During the 2008 – 2011 recession, unemployed adults were enrolling in college credit

courses at both associate (two year) and bachelor (four year) programs. People were not 

acquiring jobs, so to increase the chance of employment they were acquiring new skills 

and degrees. Fortunately for them, this strategy was successful, resulting in many 

individuals no longer perusing further education upon employment. Since interest in 

higher education dropped, the cost of college tuition continues to increase every couple of 

years. According to a U.S Department of Education survey, 33.8% of students who 

attended two-year programs in 2011 were projected to be in loan-default rather than the 

13.8% of student who graduated from a four-year bachelor program. 

Student Loan Justice is an organization dedicated to returning standard consumer 

protections to student loans and focuses primarily on research, media outreach, and 

grassroots lobbying initiatives.				                            <div class="anno-right" data-count="0">

Founder of the Student Loan Justice organization, Alan Collinge said, “Defaults are in

fact a preferred outcome for the lending system, up to and including the federal 

government.  This perverted, bad faith fiscal incentive has led to a myriad of systemic 

failings.”

Aside from loans, there are very few options for students looking to afford an

Though the economy has picked up and jobs are being created everyday, the employment 

rate in New York City is the lowest it’s been since 2008, according to the New York 

State Department of Labor. But depending on a student’s field of study – there may be 

post-graduation earning potential.												<div class="anno-right" data-count="0">

According to a PayScale College Salary Report for 2013-2014, Petroleum Engineering,

Actuarial Mathematics and Nuclear Engineering have the highest earning potential of 

a salary between $60-$103,000 for a recent grad’s starting median pay. That being said, 

PayScale also reported degrees that most students pursue degrees in Business 

Administration, Psychology, Nursing and General Biology. The National Center for 

Education Statistics data from 2010-2011 also showed a similar popularity of those 

undergraduate majors.

While it takes detailed strategic planning to look for other outlets that provide student aid,

student loans are able to provide instant relief for students working toward a degree. 

Furthermore, students have to decide on programs with high quality education and 

increase the chance of future employment, or options that are more fiscally responsible, 

but perhaps don’t afford the same level of post-collegiate opportunities.												<div class="anno-right" data-count="0">

Bridget Emslie, a New Jersey resident, graduated Ramapo College of New Jersey in May

2014. Emslie studied Nursing for four years and became employed at Mount Sinai as a 

Nurse Practitioner in Pediatric Services two months after graduation. As an In-State 

resident, Emslie’s tuition costs were cut nearly half from $22K/year to $13K/year. 

Emslie, who was also accepted to New York University, chose to attend Ramapo College 

of New Jersey not only for its excellent nursing program’s reputation but also because of 

the in-state tuition difference.												<div class="anno-right" data-count="0">

“I chose Ramapo rather than an Out-of-State school like NYU because I knew the cost 

would be significantly less. I knew once I graduated that my loans would be my problem 

since my mom wasn’t able to help me financially both before and after college,” said 

Emslie.												<div class="anno-right" data-count="0">

have a maximum benefit with a minimal amount of money being held against her. She 

also hopes to pay off her $20,000 debt with in the next ten years once her finances are in 

order.

“I didn't want to be paying off loans for the rest of my life for a degree I could get for a

Navigating the financial system as an undergraduate student can be daunting. Some 

students are able to afford some of the costs, while borrowing for the remained.

Anne Most, 22, a recent undergrad at Drexel University would have owed close to 

$150,000 for her bachelors degree but with the help of her parents and a few grants, Most 

left with a little under $50,000 in student loans.										<div class="anno-right" data-count="0">

												“I can't say that I let money have much of an impact on my undergraduate education. I guess my motto was enjoy now, pay later. Paying back my loans will certainly be a grueling process, but going to Drexel gave me opportunities that I couldn't haven gotten anywhere else, so I don't regret it at all. But call me in ten years and I'll probably say otherwise,” said Most.

The Fashion Institute of Technology undergraduate student tuition amounts to just under $18K but the full undergrad cost doesn’t stop there. If you take into account Health Insurance, Health Services, Laboratory, Estimated Books and Supplies fees – out-of-state undergraduate student could accrue a yearly charge of $20,796 and that’s not including living expenses. 

If appropriate, students can chooses to commute to school in order to save on living expenses. Kristi Stoppiello is an out-of-state resident graduating from F.I.T with an associate’s degree that she started four years ago. Associate degrees tend to take no more than two years to acquire but Stoppiello was fortunate enough to take her time earning it. Graduating as a Fine Art major, Stoppiello feels that an associate over a bachelor degree was a good choice for her.

“Many artistic fields are based solely on portfolio rather than degree,” said Stoppiello.

Stoppiello recalls choosing F.I.T not only for the specialized arts program but also because it was the cheapest of other art schools she pondered applying to. 

“I was fortunate enough to have parents who both worked very hard in order to pay my tuition. My college bills were completely paid in full and out of pocket each semester. It became far less expensive once I was no longer living in the city and taking no more than three classes a week. My parents were spending around $2,000 each semester,” said Stoppiello.

Schools like CUNY, which is a public college with multiple institutions around New York City forgive out-of-state tuition for students who:

•	Were enrolled at CUNY for the Fall 2001 semester and qualified for in-state tuition at that time. 
•	Attended a New York State high school for two or more years, graduated and applied to CUNY within five years of receiving a diploma.
•	Received an accredited GED in New York State.

Wanting to find a school that would provide her with the best education at the lowest cost, Erica Davies turned down a more preferred private college in order to pay instate tuition at CUNY. 

“It was too expensive to attend and I didn't feel that the cost was worth the education. I figured that being closer to home would save the most money. My mom went to CUNY for her Masters and loved the program, so I decided to follow suit for undergrad,” said Davies. 

With research and responsible fiscal planning, students are able to find schools that not only suit their professional interests but also save them the burden of borrowing nearly double the amount in loans for a more prestigious, out-of-state college education. 

President Obama’s Plan of Action

In January 2015, President Obama proposed that he will sign a Presidential Memorandum that will direct the Department of Education and other federal agencies to work across the federal government to do more to help borrowers afford their monthly loan payments. Within the Student Aid Bill of Rights, its student loan borrowers and the outstanding amount still to be paid categorize by each state. 

According to the bill’s White House Press Release in March, “Americans are increasingly reliant on student loans to help pay for college.” More than 70 percent of those earning a bachelor’s degree graduate with debt, which averages $28,400 at public and non-profit colleges.

New York accounts for 2,821,000 people borrowing a total of $77,516,686,000 and counting.
