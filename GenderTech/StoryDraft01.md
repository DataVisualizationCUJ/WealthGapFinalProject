“How many of you are working in tech full-time?” Chelsea Komlo, 27, asked in a hushed voice. 
Fewer than half of the women raised their hands. Komlo works as a software engineer at Thoughtworks, 
a technology company. 

She spoke to a group of 15 women, studying front-end web development at a study group hosted by 
Women Who Code NYC, an organization that hosts regular classes and conferences featuring women 
technologists.  

She shared her personal story to encourage the women to continue their journey into technology, 
a world that is primarily dominated by Caucasian and Asian men. Komlo attended a rigorous web development 
training program and later got hired at Thoughtworks, a company that prides itself on employing 
female engineers at a higher rate than other tech giants like Facebook or Google.

“The figures are low,” Komlo said. “But I do think there’s an emerging awareness so that’s exciting.”

Low is an understatement. Technology is one of the fastest-growing industries in New York City, 
employing nearly 300,000 people. Women comprise 40% of the tech workforce in New York but only 
29 percent of technical roles at companies, according to a report by HR&A Advisors, a New York-based 
advisory firm. That’s slightly higher than the national average of 26 percent, according to the 
National Center for Women and Information Technology.

Women technologists cite that a boys-club culture at technology companies makes
 men more likely to employ other men than women as one reason for their low numbers in technology. 
 
A few studies cited in a University of California Hastings report, however, 
showed that both men and women were twice as likely to hire a man for a job that required math.
Another reason is that fewer women major in computer science now than before. 
Only 18% of computer science majors who graduated with degrees were women, 
according to the National Center for Women in Technology compared to 37 percent in 1985. 
The introduction of the personal computer in the 1984 was the reason for the decline, 
some experts believe. These computers were catered to boys more than girls, giving rise to a narrative
of a techie culture created for and by men. 

While Komlo didn’t major in computer science, she and other employees at Thoughtworks acknowledged 
that having a computer science degree is helpful and makes it easier to get a job in technology. 
But even then, women in science, engineering and tech industries leave their careers at a much higher rate than men. In fact, a report from the Center for Talent Innovation shows that they are 45% more likely than their male colleagues to leave their fields within a year. The study cites an unsupportive work environment and a sense of isolation as some of the reasons for women leaving the industry.   
The lack of women in technical roles affects how many women are comfortable and confident enough in 
pursuing technology, said Vanessa Hurst, co-founder of Girl Develop it, a nonprofit that hosts 
classes on web development for women. She majored in computer science at the University of Virginia 
and considered herself lucky because there were “at least a few women” in several of her classes. 
Nonetheless, she thought that after graduating, she “would take on a less technical role because 
it seemed to be what other women did.”
When Hurst met Sarah Chipps, a fellow female web developer, the two started discussing the challenges of being the only women in class or on the job. Chipps declined to publicly discuss her challenges working in technology although she now runs an organization that supports young girls in technology. Her discussions with Hurst, however, led to the idea of Girl Develop It, an organization they founded in 2010 that teaches young women how to code. The first class, where Chipps taught HTML and CSS, sold out. From there, it spread to 46 cities and now the nonprofit operates internationally.
New York City is catching up with nonprofits’ efforts to increase gender diversity in technology. 
In May 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration launched Tech Talent Pipeline, an initiative 
that’s part of a broader effort to train New Yorkers in technology and connect them with 
companies looking for employees. The initiative’s director, Karen Titus, told New York Daily 
News that 55% of the program’s participants are women.
Major companies are starting to address the lack of diversity in their companies, as well. 
Google launched a $50 million program called Made with Code in June of 2014 to teach girls how to code, 
in a joint effort with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s MIT Media Lab, Chelsea Clinton 
and actress Mindy Kaling, among others.
Hurst and other women technologists agree. 

“Computing is one of the most powerful tools we have,” Hurst said. “And we’re not going to be 
able to solve humanity’s most important problems unless we have enough different voices 
contributing to the solution.”

It’s part of a booming trend with over 20 New York-based groups listed on Meetup.com that 
aim to increase the number of women working in technology.
